        <strong>Nobodys born smart. We all start at 0.</strong> Cant talk, cant walk, certainly cant do algebra.<br>
        Adding, reading, writing, riding a bike. Nobodys good at anything at first.<br>
        There was a time when Einstein couldnt count to 10.<br>
        And Shakespeare had to learn his ABCs just like the rest of us.<br>
        Thankfully, we are born to learn.<br>
        <em>Slowly. Surely.</em> You stumble, slip, crawl, fall and fail and fall.<br>
        <em>Frustrating. Confusing. Trying. Struggling.</em><br>
        Until one day, you walk.<br>
        One foot in front of the other. One idea on top of the next.<br>
        Each wrong answer making your brain a little bit stronger.<br>
        Failing is just another word for growing. And you keep going.<br>
        This. is. learning.<br>
        Its not that you dont get it. <br>
        You just dont get it, yet.
        <strong>Because the most beautiful, complex concepts in the whole universe<br>
        are built on basic ideas that anyone, anywhere can understand.</strong><br>
        Whoever you are, wherever you are.<br>
        </p>
        <p>
        You only have to know one thing:<br>
        You can learn anything.
